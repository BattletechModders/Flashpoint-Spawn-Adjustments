# Flashpoint-Spawn-Adjustments
Changes weights to let low difficulty Flashpoints to appear first.  This ModTek mod alters the base 10 weight to lower difficulty Flashpoints and those with rep requirements to allow them to spawn more often than harder Flashpoints.  This is intended for Career Mode when you will be able to complete some Flashpoints with the starting Lance or close to it.  This does affect campaign mode as well, but it is trivial to clear these early FPs quickly after the story is complete.

## DLC WARNING
This mod only contains the flashpoint.json files for these Flashpoints, it does not contain the MilestoneSets or any other files required to actually play the FPs it alters.
YOU MUST ONLY DOWNLOAD THE PACKAGE FOR DLC YOU OWN OR YOUR GAME MAY NOT LOAD.

## Packages
On the release page, there will be three .zip files.  One with both Flashpoint and Urban Warfare files, and two with either FP or UW files only for those who do not have both.  They all run off of the same mod.json and have the same ModTek name.
ONLY ONE PACKAGE CAN BE INSTALLED AT A TIME.

## Scaling
Flashpoints have a base 10 weight to spawn.  The Difficulty number corresponds with the Skull rating x2, so a 2.5 Skull rated FP is Difficulty 5.  The "Joint Venture" FP has a weight of 200, and all "Alliance" FP's have a weight of 1000.  I've scaled the lowest difficulty FPs to 100 and rapidly sloped down to base 10 for Difficulty 7 and up where the majority of FPs reside.

    Difficulty	Weight
    4	          100
    5	          40
    6	          20
    7	          10
    8	          10
    9	          10
    10	          10
